							<h2>Professional Experience</h2>

								<dt>
									Instacart<br />
									Data Solutions Manager
								</dt>
								<dd>
									<ul>
										Building off-platform advertising solutions at Instacart.
									</ul>
								<dt>
								<dt>
									The Washington Post<br />
									Senior Analyst, Pricing & Yield
								</dt>
								<dd>
									<ul>
										On the Pricing & Yield team I focused my efforts on forecasting the availability of our ad inventory and measuring the revenue at risk of under delivering campaigns. Additionally, I had the pleasure of working on ad targeting products including a swap from brand safety to brand suitability and performing analysis on a new contextual classifier.
									</ul>
								<dt>

									The Washington Post<br />
									Senior Business Intelligence Analyst
								</dt>
								<dd>
									<ul>
										I worked as the Business Intelligence lead for Zeus Technology, an in-house advertising technology company which operated as a startup within the Washington Post organization. 
										I worked in both a client facing and internal role supporting the following products:
										<ul>
											<ul>
												<li><b>Zeus Performance: </b>An industry leading programmatic stack and rendering engine which improved both monetization and user experience for our customers.</li>
												<li><b>Zeus Prime: </b>A self serve ad buying platform built on a network of premium publishers which gave advertisers a turnkey solution for digital buys.</li>
												<li><b>Zeus Insights: </b>First party data product which allowed for both contextual and behavioral audience targeting.</li>
											</ul>
										</ul>
									</ul>
								<dt>
									The Washington Post, Washington D.C.<br />
									Business Intelligence Analyst
								</dt>
								<dd>
									<ul>
										I joined the Post to manage programmatic analytics for the ad product team. This was a formative experience
										where I grew as both a technical analyst and a business leader. Working at the Post gave me a more wholistic
										view of digital monetization, as I had to balance programmatic strategy with digital direct products and subscriptions.
										This was also my first introduction to forecasting, where I had to balance both a quanitative and qualitative approach.
									</ul>

								<dt>
									Hive Media Group, Carlsbad, CA<br />
									Revenue Analyst
								</dt>
								<dd>
									<ul>
										This was my first full time post-grad job where I worked in analytics for the programmatic team at Hive Media. It was here that I 
										developed a strong base of technical skills, A/B testing, and ad-tech knowledge. My biggest accomplishment in this role was being trusted with
										running analytics for our M&A team where I helped complete 3 successful acquisitions and integrated these new sites into our
										data and reporting architecture.
